Neural representations of compositional structures
**************************************************

Requirements:

- Python
- Matplotlib
- `ccmsuite <https://github.com/tcstewar/ccmsuite>`_

Run the following scripts to produce figures:

- ``fig1.py`` (tuning curves of typical neurons)
- ``fig2.py`` (two-dimensional tuning curves)
- ``fig4.py`` (changing firing rates after computing a product)
- ``fig6.py`` (100-dimensional vectors)
